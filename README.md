# Self Hosting Tickets Bot

This is a guide to self host the [Tickets bot](https://discord.com/users/508391840525975553). Which was [announced to sunset on the 5th of March 2025](https://discord.com/channels/508392876359680000/508410703439462400/1325516916995129445) in [their support server](https://discord.gg/XX2TxVCq6g). This guide will help you set up the bot on your own machine using Docker. **This is not an official guide and I will not provide support.**

## Pre-requisites

- You must have knowledge of how to use, deploy and run containers (specifically Docker)
- You must have an idea of how to use a terminal
- You should have a basic understanding of GoLang, Rust, and Svelte
- You should have a basic understanding of how to use a database (specifically PostgreSQL)

## How does the bot work?

To be completely honest, I still don't know. The image below is a rough diagram of how I think the bot works after nearly a week of tinkering with the TicketsBot codebase. The dotted boxes are the containers that I did not implement into the `docker-compose.yaml` in this repository.

The image above was made using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).

## Setup

1. Open a terminal in the folder you want to install the bot in. (Or create a folder and open a terminal in that folder)
2. Clone this repository into that folder (`git clone https://github.com/DanPlayz0/ticketsbot-self-host-guide.git .`)
   - The `.` at the end is important as it clones the repository into the current folder
3. Create an `.env` file by copying the provided `.env.example` file.

   - `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: your bot token (e.g. `OTAyMzYyNTAxMDg4NDM2MjI0.YXdUkQ.TqZm7gNV2juZHXIvLdSvaAHKQCzLxgu9`)
   - `DISCORD_BOT_CLIENT_ID`: your bot's client ID (e.g. `508391840525975553`)
   - `DISCORD_BOT_OAUTH_SECRET`: your bot's client secret (e.g. `AAlRmln88YpOr8H8j1VvFuidKLJxg9rM`)
   - `DISCORD_BOT_PUBLIC_KEY`: your bot's public key (e.g. `fcd10216ebbc818d7ef1408a5c3c5702225b929b53b0a265b82e82b96a9a8358`)
   - `ADMIN_USER_IDS`: a comma-separated list of user IDs (e.g. `209796601357533184,585576154958921739,user_id,user_id`, a single id would be `209796601357533184`)
   - `DISCORD_SUPPORT_SERVER_INVITE`: the invite link to your support server (e.g. `https://discord.gg/ticketsbot`)
   - `DASHBOARD_URL`: the URL of your dashboard (e.g. `http://localhost:5000`)
   - `LANDING_PAGE_URL`: the URL of your landing page (e.g. `https://ticketsbot.cloud`)
   - `API_URL`: the URL of your API (e.g. `http://localhost:8082`)
   - `DATABASE_HOST`: your PostgreSQL host (e.g. `postgres:5432`)
   - `DATABASE_PASSWORD`: your PostgreSQL password (e.g. `password`)
   - `CACHE_DATABASE_HOST`: your cache database host (e.g. `postgres-cache:5432`)
   - `CACHE_DATABASE_PASSWORD`: your cache database password (e.g. `password`)
   - `S3_ENDPOINT`: the endpoint of your S3 bucket (e.g. `minio:9000`)
   - `S3_ACCESS`: the access key of your S3 bucket (e.g. `AbCdEfFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ`)
   - `S3_SECRET`: the secret key of your S3 bucket (e.g. `AbCdEfFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ`)
   - `ARCHIVER_AES_KEY`: your AES-128 key (e.g. `randomstring`)
     - Bash: `openssl rand -hex 16`
     - NodeJS: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(16).toString('hex'))"`
   - `ARCHIVER_ADMIN_AUTH_TOKEN`: your archiver admin auth token (e.g. `randomstring`)
   - `SENTRY_DSN`: your Sentry DSN (e.g. `https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0`)

4. Replace the placeholders in the following command and paste it at the bottom of `init-archive.sql`. There are 2 placeholders in the command, `${S3_ARCHIVE_BUCKET}` and `${S3_ENDPOINT}`. Replace them with your bucket name and S3 endpoint respectively. You can also just edit the `init-archive.sql` file too, you just have to uncomment it (by removing the `--` at the start of the line) and replace variables there.

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO buckets (id, endpoint_url, name, active) VALUES ('b77cc1a0-91ec-4d64-bb6d-21717737ea3c', 'https://${S3_ENDPOINT}', '${S3_ARCHIVE_BUCKET}', TRUE);
   ```

5. Run `docker compose up -d` to pull the images and start the bot.
6. Configure the Discord bot. ([see below](#discord-bot-configuration))
7. Register the slash commands ([see below](#registering-the-slash-commands-using-docker-recommended))

## Discord Bot Configuration

As this bot is self-hosted, you will need to configure the bot yourself. Here are the steps to configure the bot:

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click on the application you created for the bot
3. Set the `Interactions Endpoint URL` to `${HTTP_GATEWAY}/handle/${DISCORD_BOT_CLIENT_ID}`
   - Replace `${HTTP_GATEWAY}` with the URL of your HTTP Gateway (e.g. `http://localhost:8080`, you must have a [publicly accessible URL](./wiki/faq.md#6-i-want-anyone-to-be-able-to-use-the-dashboard-how-do-i-do-that) not localhost)
   - Replace `${DISCORD_BOT_CLIENT_ID}` with your bot's application/client ID (e.g. `508391840525975553`)
4. Go to the OAuth2 tab
5. Add the redirect URL `${DASHBOARD_URL}/callback` to the OAuth2 redirect URIs
   - Replace `${DASHBOARD_URL}` with the URL of your API (e.g. `http://localhost:8080`, make sure this matches what you set in the [Setup](#setup) section)

## Registering the slash commands using Docker (Recommended)

1. Build the register commands cli utility using `docker build -t ticketsbot/registercommands -f commands.Dockerfile .`
   - Get help by running `docker run --rm ticketsbot/registercommands --help`
2. Register the commands
   - Global commands only: `docker run --rm ticketsbot/registercommands --token=your_bot_token --id=your_client_id`
   - Global & Admin commands by running `docker run --rm ticketsbot/registercommands --token=your_bot_token --id=your_client_id --admin-guild=your_admin_guild_id`
